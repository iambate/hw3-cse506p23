-----Sagar--------
1. Remove files tp.c, tp2.c from hw3 folder
2. Remove warning ioctl.c: 618
Rough README:
Locking sematics:
	Every Task will have lock(task_vt_lock) that we will take and release as follows:
		i. Every system call by that task should take read lock
		ii. Every change_vt will take write lock
		iii. Take write lock on dec_rc_vt
	The vt_lock will be used as follows:
		i. Take write lock on register_vt and deregister_vt operation
		ii. Take read lock after taking task_vt_lock when doing change_vt
		iii. Take read lock when taking sys_getvtbyid, is_implemented_by_vt
		iV. Take read lock in get_vt operaion, get_vt_id_list
	task_vt_lock should be taken before vt_lock	

-----Kunal-------
1. Remove var_arg.c
2. Remove unnecessary make commands from make file
3. Check for how to stop rmmod in case there is a vector in use


----General------
1. IOCTL 3 programs
2. User programs
3. Clone system call
4. Extended sys_wrappers
5. Extended wrapper for modules
6. Assign vector table(locks)
7. Need to create install_module.sh for all modules that needs to be installed

// need to change data type of close system call, getdents as they return int and not long
//change get_dents_64 as it return ssize_t, so return that and its wrapper should be implemented in same way
