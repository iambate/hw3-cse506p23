-----Sagar--------
1. Remove files tp.c, tp2.c from hw3 folder


-----Kunal-------
1. Remove var_arg.c
2. Remove unnecessary make commands from make file
3. Check for how to stop rmmod in case there is a vector in use


----General------
1. IOCTL 3 programs
2. User programs
3. Clone system call
4. Extended sys_wrappers
5. Extended wrapper for modules
6. Assign vector table(locks)
7. Need to create install_module.sh for all modules that needs to be installed

// need to change data type of close system call, getdents as they return int and not long
//change get_dents_64 as it return ssize_t, so return that and its wrapper should be implemented in same way
