Linux prohibits a loadable module from changing the global system call
vector/table.  Linux makes it hard to change system calls, either globally
or on a per process (or process group) basis.  Having different syscalls per
process is useful for various scenarios.Our purpose is to have a different set of syscalls on per process basis.

CLONE/CLONE2

CLONE:

The behavior of clone is as follows:

a) By Default, the child inherits the parent's vector table
b) To change this default behavior and make it point to the default syscall_table(Vector id: 0),call clone with CLONE_SYSCALLS set

To implement this, __do_fork was changed to support the flag and default behavior,hence "make" at kernel level is required before testing:

	Call as: syscall(__NR_clone, SIGCHLD|CLONE_SYSCALLS,0,NULL,NULL,0);

CLONE2:

a) To make the child point to some other vector table, clone2 is called with the last parameter being the vector table id to be set

Clone2 is implemented as a module:
Steps to use the module:

Inside hw3-cse506p23/hw3
1. make clean
2. make
3. sh install_module
4. insmod module_1.ko(the vector_table module)

clone2

        call as :  syscall(__NR_clone2, SIGCHLD , 0, NULL, NULL, 0, new_vt_id); (where new_vt_id is the vector_table id(number) to be set) 
	Sample clone call in xhw3.c
